* keyboard backlight
* figure out what all the zstyle commands in zshrc are doing
* functional urxvt config
* transmission cli
* other WMs to set up
    - bspwm
    - openbox
* irssi
    - learn
    - move config files to ~/.config/irssi
    - add alias in zshrc 
        `alias irssi='irssi --home=~/.config/irssi --config=~/.config/irssi/config'`
    - find out if specifying --config is irrelevant after doing --home
* brightness script
* neovim
    - colorscheme
        - understand all of base16-atelier-lakeside.vim
        - figure out how wal grabs system colors
        - note: cursorline transparency is infeasible. Don't bother.
        - get wal to work (need t_Co=256)
    - statusline
        - color updating
* get tdrop to work. (create new terminal, not affect current)
* fill in missing unicode
* use systemd-networkd instead of netctl
    - Get wifi to connect to known networks automatically.
* conky
* global color config
    - Xresources controls all colors
    - make python script with pywal module
* background (make cycle. get a folder)
* find bitmap font
* firefox rice
* rofi config
* music (mpd, ncmpcpp, mpc)
* tint2
    create a setup to be adjacent to polybar
* polybar
    - powermenu dropdown
    - internet dropdown
        - lone glyph of either disconnected wifi, connected wifi or ethernet
        - clicking glyph will open dropdown of all available networks
            - clicking entry in dropdown will connect to that network
            - clicking wifi network while connected over ethernet is a NOP
    - date dropdown (time, dropdown is calendar with date)
    - battery dropdown
        - displays estimated time remaining
        - displays which programs are using most power
    - volume dropdown
        - Basically a NOP for the time being
        - instead of a dropdown, clicking toggles mute
* compton (general config)
* power management (sleep and hibernate)
* figure out how to exit i3 back into default terminal prompt
* fix odd zsh behaviour
    - the output from git_prompt_status affects wrap around behaviour for long lines.
    - empty tab completions when git prompt is displayed also misbehave. (tab over all
        text, copying what was already there and essesntially resetting the line over
        one tab width to the right but all existing text is still visible on right.)
