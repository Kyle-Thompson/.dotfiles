* keyboard backlight
* figure out what all the zstyle commands in zshrc are doing
* functional urxvt config
* transmission cli
* other WMs to set up
    - bspwm
    - openbox
* irssi
    - learn
    - move config files to ~/.config/irssi
    - add alias in zshrc 
        `alias irssi='irssi --home=~/.config/irssi --config=~/.config/irssi/config'`
    - find out if specifying --config is irrelevant after doing --home
* brightness script
    - Decrease by smaller ammounts at lower brightness settings
* neovim
    - statusline
        - color updating
    - have autocomplete fill in selected text but do not auto-select the first item.
* get tdrop to work. (create new terminal, not affect current)
* fill in missing unicode
* use systemd-networkd instead of netctl
    - Get wifi to connect to known networks automatically.
* conky
* global color config
    - Xresources controls all colors
    - Modify lakeside so that nvim xres colorschme matches regular lakeside colorscheme.
    - make python script with pywal module
* background (make cycle. get a folder)
* firefox rice
* rofi config
    - how to update rofi colors dynamically?
* music (mpd, ncmpcpp, mpc)
* tint2
    - create a setup to be adjacent to polybar (i3)
    - create a misc setup for generic use. (openbox)
* polybar
    - powermenu dropdown
    - internet dropdown
        - lone glyph of either disconnected wifi, connected wifi or ethernet
        - clicking glyph will open dropdown of all available networks
            - clicking entry in dropdown will connect to that network
            - clicking wifi network while connected over ethernet is a NOP
    - date dropdown (time, dropdown is calendar with date)
    - battery dropdown
        - displays estimated time remaining
        - displays which programs are using most power
    - volume
        - clicking toggles mute
    - consider switching to lemonbar for added flexibility.
* power management (sleep and hibernate)
* figure out how to exit i3 back into default terminal prompt (laptop)
* i3lock-color
* fix odd zsh behaviour
    - the output from git_prompt_status affects wrap around behaviour for long lines.
    - empty tab completions when git prompt is displayed also misbehave. (tab over all
        text, copying what was already there and essesntially resetting the line over
        one tab width to the right but all existing text is still visible on right.)
* power managerment (sleep)
* Steam
    - font issues
    - Icon split between first and second screen (i3)
* Get a good glyph font (git)
* figure out why games take over all monitors and mess up window arrangements
* rEFInd desktop setup (boot windows from custom stanza)
* no background for polybar (desktop)
* keyboard and mouse colors on linux (desktop)
* replace i3-gaps with standard i3. bspwm can handle tiling gaps.
