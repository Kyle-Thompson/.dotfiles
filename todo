    - move config files to ~/.config/irssi
    - add alias in zshrc 
        `alias irssi='irssi --home=~/.config/irssi --config=~/.config/irssi/config'`

* brightness script
* neovim
    - colorscheme
        - understand all of base16-atelier-lakeside.vim
        - figure out how wal grabs system colors

    - powermenu dropdown
    - internet dropdown
        - lone glyph of either disconnected wifi, connected wifi or ethernet
        - clicking glyph will open dropdown of all available networks
            - clicking entry in dropdown will connect to that network
            - clicking wifi network while connected over ethernet is a NOP
    - date dropdown (time, dropdown is calendar with date)
    - battery dropdown
        - displays estimated time remaining
        - displays which programs are using most power
    - volume dropdown
        - Basically a NOP for the time being
